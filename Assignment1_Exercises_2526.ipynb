    "\n",
    "Imagine that you have a GPS device that takes a measurement every 1 hr. Create a synthetic data trajectory with two periodicities for 365 days. Consider the time interval of records to be 1 hr. For ex: consider from point A to point B , it takes 60 mins to travel.  The trajectory data should include two types of periodicities (e.g., one daily and one weekly). For example, you can take your home-Snellius trajectory as a daily trajectory repeating from Monday to Friday (daily period) and your weekly trip to the supermarket or city center from home during the weekend as the second one (weekly period). Assume that you have a regular schedule (e.g. leaving every day at 8 and returning at 5). Simulate the whole trajectory (the path and the time you spend in each place). You can find GPS locations via Google Maps (right-click on map - what is here?) or any other online map service. Try to think of scenarios that make this data as accurate as possible. You can be creative about your home location because that's private information!\n",

    "\n",
    "Tip I : a periodicity of 24 is a recurring event every 24 hrs (i.e. a daily event), a periodicity of 168 hrs is a weekly event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip II: We talked so far about processing one time series. In case two time-series acquired from two coordinates is difficult to handle, try to use only one, or combine them into one value (e.g. sqrt(lat^2 + long^2)).\n",
