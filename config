# DS Lab Servers
# https://rel.liacs.nl/labs/dslab
# 
# On these servers student accounts have a limit of 5GB of shared storage which 
# can fill very easily with data, environment libraries or cached files, especially
# if you are using python with ML libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch.
# 
# You will probably need to change your package managers environment and cache location.
#
# These servers are more likely to be used by several students at the same time for labs
# or thesis purposes so your tasks may be delayed. 
# Please respect your fellow students and don't abuse these servers.
# Please note that if you use the below liacs servers, always create your working directory inside local i.e /local. Because in home directory, you are given less space.
