    "\n",
    "Imagine that you have a GPS device that takes a measurement every 10 minutes. Create a synthetic data trajectory with two periodicities for 365 days. The trajectory data should include two types of periodicities (e.g., one daily and one weekly). For example, you can take your home-Snellius trajectory as a daily trajectory repeating from Monday to Friday (daily period) and your weekly trip to the supermarket or city center from home during the weekend as the second one (weekly period). Assume that you have a regular schedule (e.g. leaving every day at 8 and returning at 5). Simulate the whole trajectory (the path and the time you spend in each place). You can find GPS locations via Google Maps (right-click on map - what is here?) or any other online map service. Try to think of scenarios that make this data as accurate as possible. You can be creative about your home location because that's private information!\n",

    "Use a constant time between waypoints / GPS locations for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip I : a periodicity of 24 is a recurring event every 24 hrs (i.e. a daily event), a periodicity of 168 hrs is a weekly event. The final time series should have a dimension of 144 (24hrs*60mins/10mins) * 365. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tip II: We talked so far about processing one time series. In case two time-series acquired from two coordinates is difficult to handle, try to use only one, or combine them into one value (e.g. lat^2 + long^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip III: Stuck with how to simulate data? Check the Lab of the first week and get some inspiration there. You are free to simulate coordinates per minute or hour. Take a decision and go with it. You can always go back to your simulation later and make it more realistic. \n",

While implementing the autocorrelaton function, you can try to implement a circular (shifting values from the end of time-series to its begining) or a non-circular version (removing values from the end of time-series).
