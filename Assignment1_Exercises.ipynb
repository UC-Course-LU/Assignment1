        "Imagine that you have a GPS device to take measurements every 10 minutes. Simulate first a clean trajectory data with two periodicities for 365 days. The trajectory data should include two types of periodicities (e.g., one daily and one weekly). For example, you could take your Home-Snellius trajectory as a daily trajectory repeating from Monday to Friday (daily period) and your weekly trip to the supermarktet or city center from home only during the weekend as the second one (weekly period). Assume that you have a regular schedule (e.g., leaving every day at 8 and returning at 5). Simulate the whole trajectory (the path and the time you spend in each places). You can find GPS locations via Google Maps (right click on map - what is here?) or any other online map service. Try to think of scenarios that make this data as accurate as possible. (You can be creative about your home location because that's private information!)\n",
